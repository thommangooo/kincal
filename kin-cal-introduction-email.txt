Subject: Introducing KinCal - Centralized Events Calendar for Kin Clubs

Dear Kin Club Members,

I'm excited to introduce you to KinCal - a new centralized events calendar designed specifically for Kin clubs across Canada. This platform addresses a common challenge we all face: keeping track of events happening across our clubs, zones, and districts.

WHY KINCAL?
Currently, Kin events are scattered across individual club websites, Facebook pages, and various communication channels. KinCal brings everything together in one place, making it easier for members and the public to discover and participate in Kin activities.

KEY FEATURES:
• Centralized Event Management: Create, edit, and manage events for your club with simple magic link authentication
• Flexible Filtering: View events by club, zone, district, or all clubs combined
• Multiple Views: Choose between calendar grid view or detailed list view
• Website Integration: Embed a calendar widget directly on your club's website
• Privacy Controls: Support for both public events and private member-only events
• Mobile-Friendly: Fully responsive design that works perfectly on all devices

HOW IT WORKS:

For Event Creators:
Club officers and authorized members can create events using a secure magic link sent to their email. No complex passwords or account management required.

For Members & Public:
Browse events by filtering for your club, zone, or district. All public events are visible to everyone, while private events require member authentication.

For Club Websites:
Generate an embed code to display your club's events directly on your website, keeping your members informed without manual updates.

BENEFITS FOR YOUR CLUB:
• Increased Visibility: Your events reach a broader audience across the Kin community
• Reduced Duplication: Avoid scheduling conflicts with other clubs in your area
• Easy Management: Simple event creation and editing process
• Professional Presentation: Clean, modern calendar interface for your events
